# [Cultures of Computing]

Summer 2016 | Volume 22, No. 4

Technology is not stagnant, it moves from place to place and person to person. In this issue 
of XRDS, we observe what happens when computing, culture, and postcoloniality collide. A major 
theme of the "Cultures of Computing" issue is how dominant narratives frame technology in 
terms of development for the global Southâ€”as opposed to from, or of, or with the global South. 

The authors in this issue address how to decolonialize computing, the participation of 
Africans in the global HCI community, and the ways in which the globalization has changed 
cultures and given rise to new identities, new practices, and new systems. You will find 
representation of a variety of views. Not only from cultures around the world, but from 
different disciplinary cultures as well. We hope this issue will spark thoughtful and 
reflective discussions and debates about the role of computing in these fluid times.
